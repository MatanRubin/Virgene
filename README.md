# My.Vim - Extensible .vimrc Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MatanRubin/my.vim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MatanRubin/my.vim)

My.Vim aims to make configuring Vim as easy as configuring every other Text
Editor or IDE.

**NOTE:** My.Vim is a very young project and most features are not yet
implemented.
